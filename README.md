Cypher is a custom model file designed to create an AI model with Ollama, specifically crafted for efficient navigation of large codebases. Acting both as a prompt and model, Cypher provides optimized, architecture-aware summaries that capture essential code relationships and dependencies. This dual-purpose tool empowers AI to offer valuable insights for architectural decisions without the need for full source code analysis.

### 🦾 Overview

Cypher simplifies using AI with complex, large-scale codebases by generating precise summaries that retain critical architectural context. Created as a custom modelfile for Ollama, Cypher also functions as a prompt compatible with any language model, making it a versatile tool for developers seeking streamlined, futuristic AI support.
